        Our story starts back in 1999, Jonathan and Patricia were classmates at EBHS.  The sparks didn't fly just yet.  Jon was too preoccupied with <i>Dawson's Creek</i> while Patricia spent her time doing her homework and going to bed early.  Jon and the younger Kirby sister became good friends.  Patricia headed off to Penn State while Moira and Jon rocked out to N*Sync in Jon's mazda. That friendship came in handy in 2007 when Moira invited Patricia to Jon's housewarming party.  At the end of the night, Patricia scored an invitation to join Jon's dodgeball team.  After a few games, he was won over by her athletic abilities and all around superb dodgeball skills.  The happy couple went on a super awkward first date and the rest is history!

        Jonathan popped the question in August 2011 on the beach in Manasquan, NJ.  A tearful 'yes' followed!  Jonathan and Patricia are looking forward to celebrating with all their family and friends on October 20th and to starting their life together as the Chu's.
