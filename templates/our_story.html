        Our story starts back in 1999 when Jonathan and Patricia were classmates at East Brunswick High School (EBHS); however, the sparks didn't fly just yet!  Jon was too preoccupied with <i>Dawson's Creek</i> while Patricia spent her time doing her homework and going to bed early.  During high school, Jon and the younger Kirby sister became good friends through their respective "jock" channels while Patricia headed off to Penn State.  In 2007, Jon moved into NYC and threw a housewarming party - this is where Jon and Moira's friendship came in handy as she invited Patricia to Jon's housewarming party.  The two hit it off like they were meeting for the first time, and by the end of the night, Patricia scored an invitation to join Jon's dodgeball team.  After a few games, he was won over by her athletic abilities and all around superb dodgeball skills (or lack thereof).  The happy couple went on a super awkward first date in midtown to an Irish pub and then onto a Martin Sexton concert...and the rest is history!

        Jonathan popped the question in August 2011 on the beach in Manasquan, NJ.  A tearful 'yes' followed!  Jonathan and Patricia are looking forward to celebrating with all their family and friends on October 20th and to starting their life together as the Chu's.
